# app/api/v1/dependencies.py

# This file is intended for common API dependencies.
# For example, functions to get a database session, an authenticated user,
# or shared service instances if not injected directly at the router level.

# from fastapi import Depends, HTTPException, status
# from sqlalchemy.orm import Session # If using SQLAlchemy
# from app.db.session import SessionLocal # Example database session factory
# from app.core.rag_pipeline import RAGPipeline, get_rag_pipeline # Example

# def get_db():
#     db = SessionLocal()
#     try:
#         yield db
#     finally:
#         db.close()

# def get_current_active_user():
#     # Placeholder for authentication logic
#     # This would typically depend on an OAuth2PasswordBearer scheme or similar
#     # and verify a token.
#     # For now, let's assume a mock user or raise NotImplementedError
#     # raise HTTPException(status_code=status.HTTP_501_NOT_IMPLEMENTED, detail="User authentication not implemented")
#     pass


# If you want to inject RAGPipeline directly into endpoints (less common if services use it):
# async def get_rag_pipeline_dependency() -> RAGPipeline:
# return get_rag_pipeline() # Assuming get_rag_pipeline is defined in rag_pipeline.py

# logger.info("Placeholder dependencies.py loaded. Define actual dependencies as needed.")
